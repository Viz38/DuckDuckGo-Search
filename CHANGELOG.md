I improved accuracy by refining search queries and enhancing name extraction. Previously, the script used broad `site:linkedin.com/in/{slug}` or `{slug} LinkedIn` queries, leading to irrelevant results. I changed this by extracting the person's name from the LinkedIn URL slug, like "nikhil samnani" from `nikhil-samnani-811074b3`, and incorporating it into the search query as `{name} site:linkedin.com/in/{slug}`. This provides more specific context to the search engine, greatly improving the relevance and accuracy of the results for LinkedIn profiles. I tested these changes on a sample, confirming a significant accuracy increase.
